***********************
Welcome to Schrodinger!

Goal of Schrodinger
===================

Schrodinger is a students project and the first time for said students to
create a somewhat bigger program. Schrodinger is capable of solving the one
dimensional time independet schrodinger equation for any potentails. The user
has to create one input file containing the needed data, which will be read and
organized in different files. The solution of the problem desbribed in the
input file will be displayed graphically aswell.

However, since this is a first time students program, the focus of this project
was primarily learning to code and espacially parallel development aswell as a
comprehensible way of documentation of this progress. Consequently, the code is
rather simple and possibly not optimal for solving complicated problems.


Version and packages
====================

Schrodinger requires Python 3.6 or higher aswell as the packages numpy, scipy,
os and matplotlib.
