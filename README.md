# Schrodinger

The program solves the one dimensional time independent schroedinger eqauation for a given potential. It also contains a script which visualizes the results of the solver.

# Motivation

This is the final project of a scientific programming course of the University of Bremen.

# Requirements


To run the program you will need Python 3.6 or higher as well as numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
To compile the API-Documentation you need Sphinx.
